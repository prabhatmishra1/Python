"""
Write a python program to check a number is prime or not ?

Solution:

What is Prime number:

A number which can divisible by itself or 1

Example: 2, 11, 13, 17,

Note: 2 only one even prime number others all are odd numbers

Note: -1, 0, 1 is not an prime number

Note: All prime number are grater then 1 Example Prime number start with 2......


First Approach:

We can check the divisibility from 1 to N and if if any number divide except itself or 1
then its not a prime number otherwise it will be a prime number

Second Approach:
Now we know if N is large number then it will more time to check in that can case we can
calculate the square root on N and then check prime number, so it will reduce the check

Note: If a number N>3 and N>3 is divisible by either 2 or 3, it cannot be a prime because it has additional divisors (2 or 3).
Note: If a number N is divisible by 2  or 3 then its not a prime number
